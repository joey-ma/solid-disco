Exploring the world of C++. #cpp

## Opinions
- Simon Ayers: *putting 'C/C++' on your CV may give an impression that you know C, and therefore, you know C++.*
  - if you put 'C/C++' on your CV and you are a C++ programmer you are selling yourself short
  - If you put 'C/C++' on your CV and you don't know idiomatic C++ you are wasting everyone's time
- Stefan Mischook: Remember to use the best tool for the job at hand and that is tied to what the project already has in place in terms of tech stack and what you want to do. C++ is often used:
  - when latency is important [link](https://qr.ae/pr8tNj)
    - banking and trading systems,
  - in game programming,
  - in computer vision
  - in legacy code, 
  - in mission critical jobs [link](https://qr.ae/pr8t17)
  
## Topics to Know
- Less important
  - Object Oriented Programming (at least conversant)
  - Declarative design pattern (can be learned quickly)
- Important
  - Polymorphism
  - Object construction / initialization 
  - Object destruction
  - Object copying - shallow vs deep
  - Const Correctness
  - Virtual keyword
  - Virtual destructors
  - Pure virtual functions
  - Function overloading
  - Operator overloading 
  - Exceptions 
  - Exception safety
  - Templates
  - Standard Template Library (STL)
  - Memory management
  - Operator new
  - Stack objects
  - Static objects
    - potential issues with respect to initialization order or thread safety
  - Smart pointers
  - RAII
- Experience
  - Actual experience is one thing, but ability to use vectors, sets, queues, etc is important.
  - Knowing how to implement a simple templated function.
